/**

 * Holds a socket at `path` and answers processes that attach to it: hands over
 * the descriptors and offsets they need to build their own view of the
 * runtime, creates queues on request, submits admin commands on their behalf,
 * and releases whatever a consumer held when it disconnects.
 *
 * Blocks until `*stop` becomes non-zero, which a signal handler is expected to
 * do. Returns when the last thing it was serving has been let go, so a caller
 * can close its devices afterwards.

 * @param path Where to hold the socket; a filesystem path, since an
 * abstract-namespace address cannot be reached from another network namespace
 * @param stop Set to non-zero to bring the loop down; typed for a signal
 * handler, since that is what usually sets it
 *
 * @return 0 on success, negative errno on error
