"""
    The xnvme.library_loader provides a single method to dynamically load the xNVMe
    shared library. This intent is that the loader is invoked by the
    'xnvme.ctypes_bindings' on package-initialization, such that the user can directly
    get a library-handle like so:

        from xnvme.ctypes_bindings import capi

    This is useful since usage of the library handle can have multiple entry points.
