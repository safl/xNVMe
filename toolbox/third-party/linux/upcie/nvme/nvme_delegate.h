/**
 * Handing a controller to another process, and what passes between them
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * The owner of a controller serves consumers over a unix socket. What crosses
 * at attach are descriptors, since nothing else moves one between unrelated
 * processes: the vfio device, the iommufd where there is one, and the heap.
 * Everything after that is a fixed-size message, and none of it is on the I/O
 * path.
 *
 * Asking what an owner is holding is on the same channel, since connecting at
 * all is most of the answer: somebody is serving that identifier.
 *
 * A consumer allocates nothing from the shared heap either, for the same
 * reason it does not touch the admin queue: the allocator is the owner's and
 * its free list has no lock. It asks, and is handed an offset. Allocation
 * belongs on the control plane in any case, being done once for memory used
 * many times.
 *
 * A consumer submits I/O itself, on queues it was granted, ringing its own
 * doorbell. What it does not do is touch the admin queue, because there is one
 * of those and its head and tail are held by value; the owner submits admin
 * commands on request instead. That costs nothing that matters, since admin is
 * not hot, and it is what lets the runtime record be written once and read
 * without a lock.
 *
 * Admin commands carry payloads, and the payload does not travel: the consumer
 * names an address the device can already reach, from memory it registered in
 * the shared address space or was granted, and the owner puts that in the
 * command. So an identify lands in the consumer's buffer without a copy, and
 * without the owner having a mapping of it.
 *
 * Which admin commands an owner submits is the owner's business, and the
 * default is to submit what it is asked. The hook is there so that an owner
 * which one day needs to refuse something has somewhere to do it.
